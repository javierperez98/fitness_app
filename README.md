## `Description`

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project.
What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? What problem does it solve? What did you learn? -->

- In this project I created a NOSQL database for a Fitness Tracker App using MongoDB, mongoose.js, express.js and node.js.
  This app lets you create a workout and add excersies to your workout. You can also create a new workout. It gives you an easy to use inferface to tracker all your workouts. I really enjoyed building this database and will being using MongoDB in the future.
